# bltk_anticheat

**An advanced free FiveM anticheat.**



## What can this anticheat do?

This anticheat can easily catch cheaters, I made a lot of function, to detect cheat menus, cheat strings, injections, and make some functions unusable.



## Configuration?

Always be careful when you are configuring this anticheat. You will need to find out which functions are working correctly on your server. A good configuration can make difference.
